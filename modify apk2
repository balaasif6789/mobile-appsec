How to Modify signed APK resources?
Here is a interesting thing!! How to modify already signed APK file.

Most of the cases you won't need this things but it's very important when you working on application which requires dynamic resources changes.

Here we go...

Step 1: Create Signed APK
Let's create a APK file as we are doing normally with all our projects...


 
Export Signed APK

Step 2: Create ZIP from APK
Locate your APK file and just rename and add/change it's extension to ".zip"

 
Rename to ".zip"


Step 3: Extract and remove existing signatures

Extract your zip file
Locate META-INF folder, and remove it

 
Remove signatures


Step 4: Modify APK Resources
Now you can modify any resources, in our example I have modified app_icon.png file, but make sure when you modify your resource keep same name of file, because name is being used in your code.

Step 5: Create a ZIP again.

Now you need to resign your APK using keystore, passwords and jarsigner tool.
FYI: jarsigner can be find under java installation.

jarsigner -verbose -keystore <PATH_TO_KEYSTORE> -storepass <KEYSTORE_PASSWORD> <PATH_TO_APK> <ALIAS_OF_KEYSTORE>


Step 8: Zipalign APK
If you want to publish your APK to Google Play Store, you must need to zipalign it.
Zipalign is command line tool and can be found under android sdk's tools folder.

zipalign -v 4 <APK_FILE_LOCATION> <NEW_PATH_OF_APK>

e.g. zipalign -v 4 Example.apk Example_signed_zipaligned.apk

Step 9: Test your APK
Don't forget to test your APK!!!
Example_signed_zipaligned.apk is final modified APK in our example.
