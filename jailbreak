This jailbreak is for iOS 12.1.2. I have used iphone 6.

1. Download the jailbreak .ipa application from the below link : 
https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff/Undecimus/releases

Download the v3.0.1 

2. We will need to sideload the ipa file. For this we will need a tool called cydia impactor.
Download the same from below link <br>
http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/

3. Run the cydia impactor tool. Drag and drop the ipa file downloaded from step 1 into the cydia impactor. You will need to
provide an Apple id and password.

4. Once the unc0ver has been side loaded head over to Settings > General > Device Management and make sure the profile is 
trusted for unc0ver app that you just sideloaded.

5.Run the unc0ver app. Tap the jailbreak button 

Important things you may know before start the jailbreak.  
•	Delete OTA update <br>
•	Some of few repos may not functioning.<br>
•	Airplane Mode should be enabled.  ( works even if not enabled) <br>
•	Siri & Touch ID should be disable. <br>
•	Before start the jailbreak process, restart the device.<br>


That’s about it. You can now launch Cydia and enjoy the jailbreak! Keep in mind that just like all the recent jailbreak <br> 
releases, this one too is semi-untethered in nature which means you will have to put the device into jailbreak mode after <br>
every reboot of the device. You can put the device in jailbreak mode by simply running the unc0ver app and then re-jailbreaking.<br> 
Also important to note is that you will have to resign and resideload unc0ver app after every seven days as the free Apple ID <br>
certificate which you used to sideload with Cydia Impactor lasts for only seven days only.
